#Mighty Maruto and the mighty brutes


##Mighty Maruto in his most exciting and probably last adventure after a long period of solitude.

Year 3000. Maruto, our hero, is the unbeatable fighter of the new century. Such a good fighter he is, that he has killed all the people in the world. Fortunately for our Maruto the time-travel machine was already invented.

In the search of new challenges it performs a time travel to the ancient past (to 1979 more concretely) with the aim of testing his manliness against other people using the most archaic and virile technology of this time: an embryo of the Z-MACHINE. He sets up a competition in which fighters willing to beat each other must know how to read and write.

Unluckily for our Maruto, only future evil copies of himself enter the competition using the same time travel machine.

# TIPS:
If some commands does not work as you expected is because this is an embryo of the Z-MACHINE.

Each round is composed of turns of a few seconds. You should perform a command in each turn.

You can chain several commands if you separate them with “;”

## Basic Actions
WALK: advances one step forward
MOONWALK: advances one step backwards
RUN: simply walk faster
TURN LEFT: turns the hero left
TURN RIGHT: turns the hero right
PUNCH : throws a punch (always available)
PICK: picks an item box (tiles marked with an exclamation point)
DROP: drops an item (the item goes elsewhere in another universe where, very likely, they will be more useful).

## There are different sort of items you can use when they are in your inventory.
Some of them can be thrown with SHOOT (SHOOT <ITEM>:  ARRRGGGHHH, CHOCO, GRENADE, RANDOM, SONICBOMB ).
Others modify your status and are operative whilst they are in your inventory:
SHIELD: you are invincible for a period of time
INVISIBILITY: you are not visible
RING: the strength of your punch is multiplied
DIZZY: you ate a poisoned mushroom. It modifies some of your commands
SNEAKERS: you run faster

Manyof them could be dropped of your inventory with DROP. Nevertheless after a period of time they get corrupt and disappear of your inventory. Try yourself!!
